# Flask-Application

This tutorial walks you through a simple flask application for implementing an NLP task (sentiment analysis).
Since this tutorial focuses on creating a flask application, i will only mention a couple of lines on the prediction model used in this example.

This example uses a Logistic Regression model trained on the tweets to classify them into either a positive class (1) or a negative class (0).

So the model takes in a sentence and predicts it to be either '1' or '0'

Feel free to use other trained models or to perform any other task.
